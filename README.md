# Basic Gym Manager
## Project assignment for codecademy CS101 course
### This Program is capable of running some basic tasks involved in managing a gym

Having had some experience in the field, I decided to use it for this project.
The main aim of the project itself is teaching how to handle the whole "creative" process involved with developing a program from scratch, including version control and this presentation readme you are reading.

Focus on this program was the Class and Objects concepts, the development started with 3 main classes in mind only to be added a 4th one during the project step that required trying to refactor and add functionality or "complexity" to the program.
The program is fully functional, but it can be expanded and developed further to include new stuff and quality of life improvements, I decided not to pursue that route for time constraints.

This has been my first true project handled in every aspect, hopefully better things are to come.
